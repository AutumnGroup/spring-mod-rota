; To link single player mission to lobby you need to follow directions below:
; 1. Create "missions" folder in lobby folder ( where lobby application is located )
; 2. In "missions" folder make a folder with your game ( example: NOTA )
; 3. In "YOUR_GAME_FOLDER" folder make a MISSION_FILE_NAME.ini ( example: 001.ini )
; 4. Fill in all the values in MISSION_FILE_NAME.ini ( Depends, About )
; 5. If mission started with predefined script ( Zero-K mission editor ) that script should be renamed to start_script.txt and placed in mission directory
;
; P.S.: Mission's description maybe in RichText HTML format: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/richtext-html-subset.html

;description of mission (for Lobby use)
Description=Our captured battle units modules lost at Battle of Tac were detected and located in distant solar system RS-X052-fUb33r. Collector frigate were sent to the possition with single purpose - destroy the captured technology until it is assimilated by insidious N.O.E. But mission failed and only we know is: frigate damaged the transporter with our tech before it landed on one of the numerous frozen moons which orbit around the fourth planet of system, but frigate was destroyed by some powerfull planetary defence system installed on the moon. It means on the moon there was not only small support base, rather we can expect the one of the asimilation Nods or some bigger reasearch facility. The situation is critical. We don't have info about strength of enemy or status of our stolen tech, but we need to be sure the tech will be destroyed or recaptured! Your command unit is warped on the planet immediately.
